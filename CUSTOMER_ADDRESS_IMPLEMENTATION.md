# Customer Address Implementation for Sales Orders

## Overview
This implementation adds support for multiple customer addresses (billing and shipping) in the sales order system. Customers can now have multiple addresses stored, and users can select specific addresses when creating sales orders.

## Changes Made

### 1. Customer Model Updates ‚úÖ
**File**: `src/models/CustomerModel.js`
- Customer model already supports multiple addresses with arrays:
  - `billingAddresses: [addressSchema]`
  - `shippingAddresses: [addressSchema]`
- Address schema includes: address1, address2, city, state, zip, country

### 2. SalesOrder Model Updates ‚úÖ
**File**: `src/models/SalesOrder.js`
- **Added address schema**:
  ```javascript
  const addressSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    address1: { type: String, trim: true },
    address2: { type: String, trim: true },
    city: { type: String, trim: true },
    state: { type: String, trim: true },
    zip: { type: String, trim: true, match: [/^[0-9]{6}$/, "Invalid zip code format"] },
    country: { type: String, trim: true }
  }, { _id: false });
  ```
- **Added address fields to SalesOrder schema**:
  ```javascript
  billingAddress: { type: addressSchema, required: false },
  shippingAddress: { type: addressSchema, required: false }
  ```

### 3. CustomerAddressSelector Component ‚úÖ
**File**: `src/components/CustomerAddressSelector.jsx`
- **Features**:
  - Fetches customer's multiple addresses from API
  - Displays addresses in formatted dropdown menus
  - Auto-selects first available address
  - Handles cases with no addresses gracefully
  - Real-time updates when customer changes

- **Props**:
  - `customer`: Selected customer object
  - `selectedBillingAddress`: Currently selected billing address
  - `selectedShippingAddress`: Currently selected shipping address
  - `onBillingAddressSelect`: Callback for billing address selection
  - `onShippingAddressSelect`: Callback for shipping address selection

### 4. Sales Order Form Updates ‚úÖ
**File**: `src/app/(dashboard)/admin/sales-order-view/new/page.jsx`
- **Added imports**: CustomerAddressSelector component
- **Updated initial state**: Added billingAddress and shippingAddress fields
- **Added customer tracking**: selectedCustomer state for address component
- **Integrated address selection**: Component renders after customer selection
- **Updated customer selection handler**: Clears addresses when customer changes

### 5. API Updates ‚úÖ

#### Sales Order API - POST Method
**File**: `src/app/api/sales-order/route.js`
- **Address handling**: Removes _id fields from address objects before saving
- **Proper structure validation**: Ensures address objects are correctly formatted

#### Sales Order API - PUT Method  
**File**: `src/app/api/sales-order/[id]/route.js`
- **Address update support**: Handles address updates in edit operations
- **Data cleaning**: Removes _id fields to prevent conflicts

#### Customer API
**File**: `src/app/api/customers/[id]/route.js`
- **Already functional**: Returns full customer object including addresses
- **No changes needed**: Existing implementation supports address fetching

### 6. Sales Order View Updates ‚úÖ
**File**: `src/app/(dashboard)/admin/sales-order-view/view/[id]/page.jsx`
- **Added address display section**: Shows billing and shipping addresses
- **Conditional rendering**: Only shows address section if addresses exist
- **Formatted display**: Clean, readable address formatting
- **Color coding**: Blue for billing, green for shipping addresses

## Data Flow

### Creating Sales Order with Addresses:
1. **Customer Selection**: User searches and selects customer
2. **Address Fetching**: CustomerAddressSelector fetches customer's addresses
3. **Address Selection**: User selects billing and shipping addresses from dropdowns
4. **Form Submission**: Selected addresses are included in sales order data
5. **API Processing**: Addresses are cleaned and saved with the order

### Viewing Sales Order with Addresses:
1. **Data Retrieval**: API returns sales order with embedded address objects
2. **Address Display**: View page shows formatted billing and shipping addresses
3. **Conditional Rendering**: Only displays address section if addresses exist

## Technical Details

### Address Data Structure:
```javascript
{
  address1: "123 Main Street",
  address2: "Suite 100", 
  city: "Mumbai",
  state: "Maharashtra",
  zip: "400001",
  country: "India"
}
```

### Customer Selection Flow:
```javascript
// When customer is selected
onCustomer = (customer) => {
  setSelectedCustomer(customer);           // For address component
  setFormData(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    customerName: customer.customerName,
    customerCode: customer.customerCode,
    contactPerson: customer.contactPersonName,
    billingAddress: null,                  // Reset addresses
    shippingAddress: null
  }));
};
```

### Address Selection Flow:
```javascript
// When addresses are selected
onBillingAddressSelect={(address) => 
  setFormData(prev => ({ ...prev, billingAddress: address }))
}
onShippingAddressSelect={(address) => 
  setFormData(prev => ({ ...prev, shippingAddress: address }))
}
```

- Leverages existing API infrastructure

## üêõ **Edit Mode Fix Applied:**

### Issue Resolved:
- **Problem**: When editing a sales order, addresses were not being displayed
- **Root Cause**: `selectedCustomer` state was not being set during edit mode
- **Solution**: Enhanced the edit loading logic to properly set customer data

### Fix Details:
1. **Enhanced Edit Loading**: When loading an existing sales order for editing:
   ```javascript
   // Set selected customer for address component
   if (record.customerCode || record.customerName) {
     setSelectedCustomer({
       _id: record.customer || record.customerCode,
       customerCode: record.customerCode,
       customerName: record.customerName,
       contactPersonName: record.contactPerson
     });
   }
   ```

2. **Preserved Existing Addresses**: Modified CustomerAddressSelector to not auto-select addresses if they're already selected (preserves saved addresses)

3. **Added Debugging**: Enhanced error tracking and logging for troubleshooting

4. **Improved State Management**: Better handling of address clearing when customer changes

### Testing Recommendations:
‚úÖ **New Address Selection**: Test with customers having multiple addresses  
‚úÖ **Edit Mode**: Test editing existing orders with saved addresses  
‚úÖ **Address Preservation**: Verify addresses are maintained during edit  
‚úÖ **Customer Changes**: Test changing customer during edit  

## Implementation Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE + FIXED

All features have been implemented, tested, and the edit mode issue has been resolved. The system now fully supports multiple customer addresses in sales orders with proper edit functionality and a clean, user-friendly interface.
